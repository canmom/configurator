This is a 'car configurator', created for an assessment task for the Mastered game development boot camp by Bryn Dickinson.

The folder of interest is [Scripts](Assets/Scripts), which has all the C# behaviours used in the project.

## A note on assets

This project file cannot be used in Unity as-is. All the large assets, such as models and textures, have not been committed to save space and avoid copyright violations. However, I have included all the project's `.meta` files, so if you were able to put the assets back you could open them in the editor.
